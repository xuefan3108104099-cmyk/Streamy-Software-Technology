# Streamy Backend Dynamic Behavioral Modeling

## System Architecture Interaction Streams

### 1. Architectural Core Mechanics
This tracking document details how application payloads pass between data layers before structural code layers are compiled. By designing how inputs move through software boundaries beforehand, we ensure development velocity remains high.

### 2. Media Playback Transaction Loop
The sequence model below outlines how the system validates viewer access permissions before initiating video file playback:

    actor Viewer as 👤 Platform Viewer
    participant Auth as 🔒 Auth Token Validator
    participant Catalog as 🎬 Media Catalog Engine

    Viewer->>Auth: 1. Request Playback Route (stream_id, token)
    Auth->>Auth: 2. Check token expiration state
    alt token is expired / invalid
        Auth-->>Viewer: 3a. Return 401 Unauthorized Payload
    else token is active
        Auth->>Catalog: 3b. Request Streaming Meta‑payload (stream_id)
        Catalog->>Catalog: 4. Fetch content encryption descriptors
        Catalog-->>Viewer: 5. Handshake OK (Return 200 OK + HLS Stream URL)
    end
