# Streamy Core Domain Structural Architecture

## Foundational Object‑Oriented Entity Specifications

### 1. Conceptual Domain Breakdown
This tracking document establishes the baseline static structures for the Streamy streaming platform codebase. By translating system requirements nouns straight into unified class schemas, we guarantee the underlying database and Python structures align perfectly.

### 2. Base Entity Model Class Diagram
The architectural class schema below plots our primary data properties, encapsulation metrics, and loose directional system associations:
