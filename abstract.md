# Streamy Video Streaming Backend Platform
## Project Inception and Structural System Abstract

### 1. Architectural Core Objectives
Streamy is an object‑oriented backend media management catalog designed to serve as the core engine for an enterprise digital video streaming marketplace. The application tracks, structures, and processes the relationships between underlying media formats, classification taxonomies, and user metric collections.

### 2. Primary System Boundaries
The diagram below maps out the explicit boundary conditions separating internal Python engine logic from external architectural infrastructure:
