## Project Baseline: Streamy Video Streaming Core Engine
# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

### 1. Functional Requirements (FR)
The Streamy core processing layer must execute the following functional automation features:

- **FR-1:** The system must process an individual media catalog database searchable by categorical Genre taxonomies.
- **FR-2:** The system must handle multi‑season episodic indexing structures for mapped TV Show entities.
- **FR-3:** The system must allow users to log numerical and text‑based Review metrics against media elements.
- **FR-4:** The system must track viewer consumption metrics for metadata analytics extraction.
- **FR-5:** The system must support data serialization schemas for media item state inheritance.

### 2. Non‑Functional Requirements (NFR)
The application architecture is constrained by the following systemic performance parameters:

- **NFR‑1 (Runtime environment):** The final functional system must compile exclusively inside a pure Python 3.x execution environment.
- **NFR‑2 (Maintainability Paradigm):** All system design schematics, relationship maps, and entity models must render natively inline via plain‑text syntax.
- **NFR‑3 (Data Integrity):** The underlying database must enforce cascading deletion operations across nested entity constraints.

### 3. Functional System Boundary Diagram
